Cohort Exercise 10
In any iteration, there are 10 possible paths, with 1 of the paths ending the loop.
Assuming the loop in the manipulate() function executes at most 100 times, 
it can execute anywhere between 0 to 100.

n = 0, i = 1 (the while loop escapes)
n = 1, i = 9 + 1 
n = 2, i = 9 * 9 + 9
n = 3, i = 9 * 9 * 9 + 9 * 9

for any n, the number of paths will be 9^n + 9^(n-1), n > 0.

Cohort Exercise 11
The test suite also contains condition coverage as there is at least one test case which satisfies each condition
and dissatisfies it.
